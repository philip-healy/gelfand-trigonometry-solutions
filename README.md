*Trigonometry* by Gelfand and Saul is often recommended as a precalculus text for self-study.
However, those who are learning without the help of a teacher can struggle with the lack of solutions to exercises in the text.
A [partial set of solutions for *Trignonometry*](https://jbeach50.weebly.com/gelfand--saul-trig-solutions.html) (odd numbered exercises only) has been published by John Beach.
It is hoped that this repository will eventually contain a complete set of solutions that can be viewed as HTML or downloaded in PDF format.

The Travis CI build configuration is based on [LaTeX-Travis-Pages](https://github.com/prewriter/LaTeX-Travis-Pages).
